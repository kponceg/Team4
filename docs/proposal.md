# Summary
The purpose of this project is to build an AI agent that designs and manages diverse metro networks with the objective of making the most efficient and feasible connections. We are using a Mini Metro style environment to minimize congestion under growing passenger demand. The agent receives as input a representation of the current system state, including the existing network map, passenger distributions and queues at stations, train capacities, and system constraints. Based on this information, the agent outputs network-level actions such as adding or removing connections, extending or rerouting lines, or reallocating limited resources. Our main objective for this project is to learn how to manage an AI agent and different heuristics in a video game that reflects real-life problems, and provides feedback on circumstances that aren't completely unknown to the real world.
# Algorithms
Minimum Goal:
• An agent that replaces the connections to minimize the congestion of routes.
• Evaluation of changes on the agent depending on the heuristic.
